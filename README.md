# Text Archiver

A silly little text archiver, written in Rust. Let's you store some text and tag it. Output is saved to a file called archive.txt. New information is appended to the same file. Output is in json format as a key-value pair.

_Usage_

./textarchiver --tag tagtext --information texttostore
